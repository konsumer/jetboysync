This project is a simple CLI dropbox clone, written in mono using C#, that uses a standard mercurial repo as the "share" and allows multiple users to sync stuff however they like (over a remote mercurial repository) It is still very rough, but has been tested in Ubuntu, Mac, and Windows. You need the "hg" command in your path. Windows & Mac users can install [TortoiseHG](http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/) and Ubuntu users can run sudo apt-get install mercurial. You will also need mono working. Your repos should have auth setup, so you don't need a password.
